# BlockVoid

ECE2029 Final Project 
A game where you use the two UP-DOWN buttons to avoid the coming obstacles.​

Displayed on the built-in 7 segment LEDs on Basys 3 board​

How it functions: 

Many types of obstacles (blocks) generated randomly, moving from right to left with increasing speed​
The character you control is in the LED 2 (0 is the rightmost, 3 is the leftmost). You can move the character to 5 positions to avoid the blocks​
Game ends only if the reset button is hit or the player crashes/ cannot avoid the blocks in time. Score will appear after a Game over.​​
